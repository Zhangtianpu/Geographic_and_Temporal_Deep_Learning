## Code Structure
  * scal: There are some files under this folder, containing the parameters of normalization using the Z-score method.
  * data_process.py: This file provides scores of methods to tackle raw data including using the Z-score method to scale data, generating graphs and historical temporal features, and so on.
  * GCN_LSTM.py: This file is used to construct our model to predict traffic flow on the highway.
  * lstm_net.py: This file is used to construct the LSTM model.
  * main.py: This file is used to run the whole process from generating data, constructing the model, and to the final prediction.
  * my_parameter.py: This file is written some parameters related to the data storage path, model storage path, and so on.

## Dataset
   I couldn't upload the raw data due to confidentiality, because the data was used by the government to monitor the functioning status of highways in certain areas.
